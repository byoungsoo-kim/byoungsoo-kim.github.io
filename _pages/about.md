Hi! I am Byoungsoo, a neuroscientist who is doing Master's in Computational Neuroscience at [Tuebingen](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de). In this website, you can find information about me. If you are interested in my current and previous research topics as well as myself, stay on this tab. For my previous publications and conferences, go to **Publication** tab above. You can also see and download my **CV** from the tab above. Hope you enjoy reading my website!


Investigate connectomes to understand how biological neural networks solve tasks efficiently
=====

My main research interest is answering how biological neural networks solve multiple tasks efficiently. To investigate this question, I am using computational and theoretical approaches to investigate connectomes, combined with animal experiment datasets. I believe this approach will lead to understanding the network-level mechanism of brain functions. In the long term, I would like to build artificial systems, driven by neural mechanisms revealed through this approach.

### Investigating the celltype heterogeneity of T4 motion-detection neurons

Using Janelia's fruit fly full optic lobe connectome, I predicted the tuning directions of T4 cells using three different methods: analyzing the raw connectivity graph, simulating an untrained connectome-constrained network, and simulating trained connectome-constrained networks.

### Investigating the neural basis underlying fly's backward walking

Using Janelia's fruit fly ventral nerve cord connectome, I studied how MDNs trigger backward walking upon stimulation. I built a connectome-constrained network governing the movements of the fly's hindleg, trained them using behavioral experimental datasets, and analyzed the trained network to underpin the mechanism behind the leg oscillation.
